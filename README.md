# SubSink

SubSink is a game where you play as a submarine destroyer, trying to destroy submarines and not letting them destroy you.

## Gameplay

Press the left or right arrows to accelerate left or right.
Press Z to drop a depth charge off your left side, and X to drop one off your right.
Your health is represented in the upper right corner and your charge stock in the left corner.
You have four charges, which replenish when an active charge either explodes or is lost to the depths.
The submarines will attack you with "height charges" (TODO I don't know if there's a better name for these??), so avoid them.

## Code Structure

This is a simple Swing app.
The `Main` class contains little besides a `World` - a `JPanel` which holds the game state.
Besides this and a simple `ImageLoader`, the rest of the classes are `Entity`s, agents and objects within the game.
Every 30ms, each entity is given an opportunity to respond to the presence of other entities and redraw itself on the board.

## W18 Final Remarks
Helpful things to know for the project:

- Make sure you know GUIs well (book is useful for the basics), get familiar with how exactly frames, buttons, and panes interact with each other [Frame examples](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/frame.html) are helpful to understand how everything works together
- Get familiar with the code in the World classes, and how paint() and update works -- critical when it comes to modifying the behaviour of the gameplay
- Know about the Entity design pattern being used in the code:
  - A sub, ship, height charges, depth charges are all entities
  -Entities can interact with each other
  - Entities can spawn other entities
  - Entities can update themseleves to keep the game flowing
  - More entities can be added and they can interact with other entities

Current known bugs:
- A submarine could be destroyed twice if two charges hit it at the same time
- There's no way to exit to the main menu (or even exit the game) unless the game is over
